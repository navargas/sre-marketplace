Welcome!

We have upgraded to V2 and the old login system has been replaced!

Now docks.rocks uses your IBM Intranet ID for username and password.
To sign into docks.rocks with your docker client, place your country
abbreviation at the end of your Notes shortname, separated by an
underscore.

For example, if your email is "mclean@us.ibm.com" your docks.rocks
username will be "mclean_us"

  docker login docks.rocks
  username: mclean_us
  password: this1smYpassw!
  email: [this can be left blank, just press enter]

docks.rocks now requires that images are tagged with your username
before being uploaded. If you have an image named "nginx" run:

  docker tag nginx docks.rocks/mclean_us/nginx
  docker push docks.rocks/mclean_us/nginx

You cannot upload/modify an image with a username that does not
match your own.
